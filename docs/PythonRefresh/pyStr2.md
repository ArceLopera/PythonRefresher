**String Operations**: 
(+) concatenation
(*) multiplication - Strings can also be multiplied by integers. This produces a repeated version of the original string.

**User Input**: The input function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a string

``` py
print("spam"+" eggs")
print("spam "*3)
name= input("your name is?")
print("Hello "+name)
```
```
spam eggs
spam spam spam
