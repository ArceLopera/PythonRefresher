## Arrays

### First Duplicate

Asked by Google - 15 min - Easy

Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

**Example**

For a = [2, 1, 3, 5, 3, 2], the output should be solution(a) = 3.

There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.

For a = [2, 2], the output should be solution(a) = 2;

For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be solution(a) = -1.

**Solutions**

Solution 1
``` py
def solution(a):
    seen = set()
    for i in a:
        if i in seen:
            return i
        seen.add(i)
    return -1
```

Solution 2
``` py
def solution(a):
    for i in a:
        a[abs(i)-1] *= -1
        if a[abs(i)-1] > 0:
            return abs(i)
    return -1
```

### First Not Repeating Character
Asked by Amazon - 15 min - Easy

Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

**Example**

For s = "abacabad", the output should be
solution(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
solution(s) = '_'.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.

``` py
from collections import Counter
def solution(s):
    st=Counter(s)
    print(st.keys())
    for i in st.keys():
        print(i)
        if st[i] == 1:
            return i
            
    return'_'
```
``` py
def solution(s):
    chk = []
    for i in range(len(s)): 
        if s[i] not in s[i+1:] and s[i] not in chk:
            return s[i]
        chk.append(s[i])
    return '_'
```

### Rotate Image

Asked by Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple - 15 min - Easy

Note: Try to solve this task in-place (with O(1) additional memory), since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

You are given an n x n 2D matrix that represents an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

**Example**

For a = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]]
the output should be solution(a) =
    [[7, 4, 1],
     [8, 5, 2],
     [9, 6, 3]]

**Solutions**

``` py
def solution(a):
    a = list(zip(*a))    
    a = [list(l[::-1]) for l in a]
    
    return a
```
``` py
def solution(a):
    return list(zip(*reversed(a)))

### Sudoku 2

Asked by Apple and Uber - 30 min - Easy

Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with numbers in such a way that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid all contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 one time.

Implement an algorithm that will check whether the given grid of numbers represents a valid Sudoku puzzle according to the layout rules described above. Note that the puzzle represented by grid does not have to be solvable.

**Example**

For
```
grid = [['.', '.', '.', '1', '4', '.', '.', '2', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '6', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '1', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '6', '7', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '9'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '8', '1', '.'],
        ['.', '3', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '6'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '7', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '5', '.', '.', '.', '7', '.']]
```
the output should be
solution(grid) = true;

For
```
grid = [['.', '.', '.', '.', '2', '.', '.', '9', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '6', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['7', '1', '.', '.', '7', '5', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '7', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '8', '3', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '8', '.', '.', '7', '.', '6', '.'],
        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '2', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '1', '.', '2', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],
        ['.', '2', '.', '.', '3', '.', '.', '.', '.']]

```
the output should be
solution(grid) = false.

The given grid is not correct because there are two 1s in the second column. Each column, each row, and each 3 × 3 subgrid can only contain the numbers 1 through 9 one time.

### Is Crypt Solution

Asked by Palantir Solutions - 15 min - Easy

A cryptarithm is a mathematical puzzle for which the goal is to find the correspondence between letters and digits, such that the given arithmetic equation consisting of letters holds true when the letters are converted to digits.

You have an array of strings crypt, the cryptarithm, and an an array containing the mapping of letters and digits, solution. The array crypt will contain three non-empty strings that follow the structure: [word1, word2, word3], which should be interpreted as the word1 + word2 = word3 cryptarithm.

If crypt, when it is decoded by replacing all of the letters in the cryptarithm with digits using the mapping in solution, becomes a valid arithmetic equation containing no numbers with leading zeroes, the answer is true. If it does not become a valid arithmetic solution, the answer is false.

Note that number 0 doesn't contain leading zeroes (while for example 00 or 0123 do).

**Example**

For crypt = ["SEND", "MORE", "MONEY"] and
```
solution = [['O', '0'],
            ['M', '1'],
            ['Y', '2'],
            ['E', '5'],
            ['N', '6'],
            ['D', '7'],
            ['R', '8'],
            ['S', '9']]
```
the output should be
solution(crypt, solution) = true.

When you decrypt "SEND", "MORE", and "MONEY" using the mapping given in crypt, you get 9567 + 1085 = 10652 which is correct and a valid arithmetic equation.

For crypt = ["TEN", "TWO", "ONE"] and
```
solution = [['O', '1'],
            ['T', '0'],
            ['W', '9'],
            ['E', '5'],
            ['N', '4']]
```
the output should be
solution(crypt, solution) = false.

Even though 054 + 091 = 145, 054 and 091 both contain leading zeroes, meaning that this is not a valid solution.

**Solution**

``` py
def solution(crypt, solution):
    # a + b = c
    a = crypt[0]
    b = crypt[1]
    c = crypt[2]
    ch_dict = {}

    for s in solution:
        ch_dict[s[0]] = int(s[1])

    hasLeadingZeros = False
    if ch_dict[a[0]] == 0 or ch_dict[b[0]] == 0 or ch_dict[c[0]] == 0:
        hasLeadingZeros = True

    n1 = ''.join([str(ch_dict[i]) for i in a])
    n2 = ''.join([str(ch_dict[i]) for i in b])
    n3 = ''.join([str(ch_dict[i]) for i in c])

    if int(n1) + int(n2) == int(n3):
        if hasLeadingZeros and int(n3) == 0 and len(n3) == len(str(int(n3))):
            return True
        elif hasLeadingZeros:
            return False
        else:
            return True
    else:
        return False

## LinkedLists

### Remove K from List

15 min - Easy

Note: Try to solve this task in O(n) time using O(1) additional space, where n is the number of elements in the list, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers l and an integer k, remove all elements from list l that have a value equal to k.

**Example**

For 
```
l = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
```
and k = 3, the output should be
```
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 4, 5];
```
For 
```
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 
```
and k = 10, the output should be
```
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
```
**Solution**

``` py
# Singly-linked lists are already defined with this interface:
# class ListNode(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.next = None

### Add Two Huge Numbers

30 min - Easy

You're given 2 huge integers represented by linked lists. Each linked list element is a number from 0 to 9999 that represents a number with exactly 4 digits. The represented number might have leading zeros. Your task is to add up these huge integers and return the result in the same format.

**Example**

For a = [9876, 5432, 1999] and b = [1, 8001], the output should be
solution(a, b) = [9876, 5434, 0].

Explanation: 987654321999 + 18001 = 987654340000.

For a = [123, 4, 5] and b = [100, 100, 100], the output should be
solution(a, b) = [223, 104, 105].

Explanation: 12300040005 + 10001000100 = 22301040105.

``` py

### Reverse Nodes in K Groups

45 min - Hard

Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in l, and O(1) additional space complexity, since this is what you would be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Given a linked list l, reverse its nodes k at a time and return the modified list. k is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of l. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left out at the end should remain as-is.

You may not alter the values in the nodes - only the nodes themselves can be changed.

**Example**

For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [2, 1, 4, 3, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 1, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(l, k) = [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10, 11].

**Solution**

``` py
# Singly-linked lists are already defined with this interface:
# class ListNode(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.next = None
#
def solution(l, k):
    if not l:
        return l
    c = l
    n = k
    while c and n:
        c = c.next
        n -= 1
    if n:
        return l
    curr = l
    prev = None
    next = None
    n = k
    while curr and n:
        next = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next
        n -= 1
    if next:
        l.next = solution(next, k)
    return prev
```

### Rearrange Last N

40 min - Hard

Note: Try to solve this task in O(list size) time using O(1) additional space, since this is what you'll be asked during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers l and a non-negative integer n, move the last n list nodes to the beginning of the linked list.

**Example**

For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and n = 3, the output should be
solution(l, n) = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and n = 1, the output should be
solution(l, n) = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

**Solution**

``` py
# Singly-linked lists are already defined with this interface:
# class ListNode(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.next = None

## Hashtables

### Grouping Dishes

Asked by Linkedin - 20 min - Easy

You are given a list dishes, where each element consists of a list of strings beginning with the name of the dish, followed by all the ingredients used in preparing it. You want to group the dishes by ingredients, so that for each ingredient you'll be able to find all the dishes that contain it (if there are at least 2 such dishes).

Return an array where each element is a list beginning with the ingredient name, followed by the names of all the dishes that contain this ingredient. The dishes inside each list should be sorted alphabetically, and the result array should be sorted alphabetically by the names of the ingredients.

**Example**

For
``` py 
  dishes = [["Salad", "Tomato", "Cucumber", "Salad", "Sauce"],

### Are Following Patterns

Asked by Google - 30 min - Easy

Given an array strings, determine whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array. In other words, there should be no i and j for which strings[i] = strings[j] and patterns[i] ≠ patterns[j] or for which strings[i] ≠ strings[j] and patterns[i] = patterns[j].

**Example**

For strings = ["cat", "dog", "dog"] and patterns = ["a", "b", "b"], the output should be
solution(strings, patterns) = true;
For strings = ["cat", "dog", "doggy"] and patterns = ["a", "b", "b"], the output should be
solution(strings, patterns) = false.

**Solution**

``` py
def solution(strings, patterns):
    return len(set(strings)) == len(set(patterns)) == len(set(zip(strings, patterns)))

```

### Contains Close Nuns

Asked by Palantir - 30 min - Medium

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, determine whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array where nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is less than or equal to k.

Example

For nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
solution(nums, k) = true.

There are two 2s in nums, and the absolute difference between their positions is exactly 3.

For nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 2, the output should be
solution(nums, k) = false.

The absolute difference between the positions of the two 2s is 3, which is more than k.

**Solution**

``` py
def solution(nums, k):
    dct={}#key:number, value:index contains the last occurance index of a number
    if not nums or k==0:
        return False

    for index,num in enumerate(nums):
        try:
            if index-dct[num] <= k:
                return True
        except:
            pass
        dct[num]=index

    return False
```

### Possible Sums

Asked by Google - 45 min - Hard

You have a collection of coins, and you know the values of the coins and the quantity of each type of coin in it. You want to know how many distinct sums you can make from non-empty groupings of these coins.

**Example**

For coins = [10, 50, 100] and quantity = [1, 2, 1], the output should be
solution(coins, quantity) = 9.

Here are all the possible sums:

```
50 = 50;
10 + 50 = 60;
50 + 100 = 150;
10 + 50 + 100 = 160;
50 + 50 = 100;
10 + 50 + 50 = 110;
50 + 50 + 100 = 200;
10 + 50 + 50 + 100 = 210;
10 = 10;
100 = 100;
10 + 100 = 110.
```
As you can see, there are 9 distinct sums that can be created from non-empty groupings of your coins.

**Solution**

``` py
def solution(coins, quantity):
    possible_sums = {0}
    for c, q in zip(coins, quantity):
        possible_sums = {x + c * i for x in possible_sums for i in range(q + 1)}
    
    return len(possible_sums) - 1
```

### Swap Lex Order

Asked by Meta - 45 min - Hard

Given a string str and array of pairs that indicates which indices in the string can be swapped, return the lexicographically largest string that results from doing the allowed swaps. You can swap indices any number of times.

**Example**

For str = "abdc" and pairs = [[1, 4], [3, 4]], the output should be
solution(str, pairs) = "dbca".

By swapping the given indices, you get the strings: "cbda", "cbad", "dbac", "dbca". The lexicographically largest string in this list is "dbca".

**Solution**

``` py
def solution(strn, pairs):
    # if not strn or not pairs : return strn
    # check for connected node groupings which can be sorted individually
    grp = {} # set of all possible locations an index could end up
    for a,b in pairs : 
        g = grp.get(a,{a}) | grp.get(b,{b}) 
        for n in g : # reset all nodes in group
            grp[n] = g
    for n in grp : 
        grp[n] = tuple(sorted(grp[n]))
    reord = {}
    for c in set(grp.values())  : 
        word = sorted((strn[i-1] for i in c), reverse = True)
        for i,l in zip(c,word) : 
            reord[i-1] = l # string is 0 indexed
    return ''.join(reord.get(i,x) for i,x in enumerate(strn))
```
## Trees: Basic

### Has Path With Given Sum

20 min - Easy

Given a binary tree t and an integer s, determine whether there is a root to leaf path in t such that the sum of vertex values equals s.

**Example**

For

```
t = {
    "value": 4,
    "left": {
        "value": 1,
        "left": {
            "value": -2,
            "left": null,
            "right": {
                "value": 3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        },
        "right": null
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 3,
        "left": {
            "value": 1,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 2,
            "left": {
                "value": -2,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            },
            "right": {
                "value": -3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        }
    }
}
```
and
s = 7,
the output should be solution(t, s) = true.

This is what this tree looks like:
```
      4
     / \
    1   3
   /   / \
  -2  1   2
    \    / \
     3  -2 -3
```
Path 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> -2 gives us 7, the required sum.

For
```
t = {
    "value": 4,
    "left": {
        "value": 1,
        "left": {
            "value": -2,
            "left": null,
            "right": {
                "value": 3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        },
        "right": null
    },
    "right": {
        "value": 3,
        "left": {
            "value": 1,
            "left": null,
            "right": null
        },
        "right": {
            "value": 2,
            "left": {
                "value": -4,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            },
            "right": {
                "value": -3,
                "left": null,
                "right": null
            }
        }
    }
}
```
and
s = 7,
the output should be solution(t, s) = false.

This is what this tree looks like:
```
      4
     / \
    1   3
   /   / \
  -2  1   2
    \    / \
     3  -4 -3
```
There is no path from root to leaf with the given sum 7.

**Solution**
``` py
#
# Definition for binary tree:
# class Tree(object):
#   def __init__(self, x):
#     self.value = x
#     self.left = None
#     self.right = None
def solution(t, s):
    if t is None:
        return s == 0    

    return solution(t.left, s - t.value) or solution(t.right, s - t.value)
```
